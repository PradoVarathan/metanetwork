1) attempting to integrate mrnet (in parmigene package)
  i) implementation: first run ARACNE to get MI estimates
  ii) then run mrnet - works on test data
2) attempting to integrate ggm - NO
3) c3 net - YES (in c3net package, c3net function (gene x samples))
4) nonlinear correlation - working on it
5) stability selection
6) wgcna (soft threshold)
7) elastic net fix


final method list for paper pipeline!
ridge cv1se
elastic net cv1se
lasso cv1se
sparrow1 (updated with bugs fixed)
aracne
wgcna (Hard threshold)
wgcna (Soft threshold)
tigress (classic 5 predictors)
genie3
c3net
mrnet
stability selection
nonlinear correlation
