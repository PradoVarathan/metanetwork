1) attempting to integrate mrnet (in parmigene package)
  i) implementation: first run ARACNE to get MI estimates
  ii) then run mrnet - works on test data
2) attempting to integrate ggm - NO
3) c3 net - YES (in c3net package, c3net function (gene x samples))
4) nonlinear correlation - working on it
5) stability selection
6) wgcna (soft threshold)
7) elastic net fix


final method list for paper pipeline!
